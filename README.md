# Classic Arcade Game Frogger Project
An HTML5 Canvas powered arcade game, developed using the best practices in Object Oriented JavaScript. The objective is to move your player across the road and reach water without being touched by enemy Bugs to win!

## How to Play 
1. Fork the game from Github or download the zip file.
2. If downloading the zip file unzip it.
3. Open index.html in your browser.
4. Use your arrow keys to move the player in all the four directions.
5. Collision with an enemy bug,will reset the player to starting position.
6. If you reach the water without colliding with any enemy bug, you win!

## Rules 
Use the arrow keys left, right, up and down to cross the road and reach water. Be careful not to collide with any enemy bugs though or you'll have to start over as game reset itself.

Good luck!!!

## Development
In order to practice object oriented JavaScript, I made sure the functions I wrote were **object-oriented** - either class functions (like `Player` and `Enemy`) or class prototype functions such as `Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions`. I also made sure that the keyword `this` is used appropriately within the class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon.
